This student guide builds on the generic [Learn Static GitHub Module](https://github.com/learn-static/foundations-0-github), and on this [2020 CollectionBuilder-GH Tutorial](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/workshop/gh/)
- During the first week of this workshop you will be customizing your CollectionBuilder-GH template using materials in the **student_resources** folder of [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/learn-static/collectionbuilder-workshop), which may be downloaded separately from the entire repository using [this link](https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/learn-static/collectionbuilder-workshop/tree/main/student_materials) generated via [DownGit](https://downgit.github.io/#/home)
