## Digital Collections & Storytelling with CollectionBuilder, Week 1: Building a Digital Archive using CollectionBuilder

In this workshop series you will learn how to create a website displaying a digital collection using free, open-source software (CollectionBuilder). Faculty, researchers, students, and staff are welcome. This workshop series is appropriate for anyone who wants to learn to build their own website to display a digital collection, whether for a class, a grant, or a digital humanities project. You can also use this software to create a personal website showcasing your professional portfolio as an architect, designer, or artist. You should be comfortable learning new things, but no prior experience with web design is required.

We will begin by exploring what a digital collection is. We will help you set up an account on GitHub—the platform that will host our website for free—and show you a little bit about how interact with that platform. In the second hour of the workshop, you will learn to import sample data into a project. By the end of the session, you will have a live website!

Our sample project ([demo version here](https://kmthorn.github.io/collectionbuilder-demo1/)) replicates an openly licensed digital exhibit, [Yōkai Senjafuda](https://glam.uoregon.edu/yokaisenjafuda/page/welcome), built by the University of Oregon Libraries and the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art, with support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

| 1. 5 minutes   | Transition or quick break  |   |
| 2. 5 minutes   | Make your own CollectionBuilder template and display it as a website           | 1. Start new project by creating a copy of the code on GitHub by clicking the “Use this Template” button, [https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-gh) <br>2. Enable GitHub pages, and add a link to your newly enabled page to the “about” part of your website.  <br> 3. Configure your website in the _config.yml file in your new repository. Update URL Variables and Site Settings sections for your new project|
| 3. 5 minutes  | How does this website know what images to display, and how can we change them? | Lecture: brief overview of the contents of the repository, clicking through.<br><br>- README.md - notice link to instructions for using this template<br>- _config.yml - notice that this controls elements of the site at a high level<br>- _data folder - note the demo-metadata.csv file referenced in _config.yml<br>- docs folder - instructions for using various parts of the website<br>- objects folder - note the images, which correspond to the names in the metadata.csv and to the images on the website, and the readme.md file with instructions on adding images to your project<br>- pages folder - note that the markdown pages here are not the final pages served by Jekyll. Rather, they instruct Jekyll on how to create the final html pages served by GitHub pages. Compare right click “view page source” image of html to the md file. |
| 5. 15 minutes  | Upload sample metadata and images | 1. Download our sample project metadata and images.
