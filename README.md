# to do list

## this documentation is a work in progress. Things that need doing with the documents:
- fix scss custom stylings to impove table layouts: 
    - add borders and padding
- add UOregon branding/icon image and connect
- add a "table of contents" and links to anchors at headings for Lesson 1, where the workshop is broken up into three smaller lesson plans.
- develop a more consistent visual look for the lesson plans and materials

## Things that need doing on the lesson plans themselves:
- Lesson plan 1:
    - Add metadata csv and images to this repo for using in Lesson plan 1. 
    - Add instructions on how to add these to the students' documents to the Lesson plan.
- Lesson plan 2: 
    - review the lesson plan and either add a css section or a follow up on metadata csv
    - based on finalizing plan, add content as needed
- Lesson plan 3: 
    - Initial draft
    - re-evaluate to do
- All lessons
    - proofread, evaluate for style
