# Digital Collections & Storytelling with CollectionBuilder

This repostiory will soon contain lesson plans, materials, and videos associated with a CollectionBuilder workshop held at the University of Oregon Libraries DREAM Lab. Our goal is to include all of the information you will need to offer this workshop at your own institution.
