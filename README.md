# Digital Collections & Storytelling with CollectionBuilder

This repostiory contains lesson plans and materials associated with a CollectionBuilder workshop held at the University of Oregon Libraries DREAM Lab. Our goal is to include all of the information you will need to offer this workshop at your own institution. 

Theme partly based on [Simple Sidebar by Start Bootstrap](https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-simple-sidebar) and [workshop-template-b by evanwill](https://github.com/evanwill/workshop-template-b).
